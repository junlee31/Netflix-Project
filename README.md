Netflix Greenlight Decision Project:

Project Introduction:

Team Tortuga looked at Netflix, a production and subscription-based streaming company that offers a wide-range of streaming services and content to users all around the globe. Founded in 1997, Netflix has now amassed over 203 million subscribers as of 2021, but it is important to note that growth has slowed down due to the emergence of new competitors such as Disney Plus and HBO Max. Since 2013, Netflix has invested large amounts of capital to produce original series and movies, with budgets for some single episodes in the millions. However, there is a great amount of risk that goes into this strategy—if new content does not appeal to current and potential Netflix customers, the company can lose tremendous amounts of money on wasted efforts. We aim to develop a way to help Netflix executives decide what kind of film content would be more effective to “greenlight” using machine learning. Essentially, we would be predicting how viewers will rate a new movie based on factors such as duration, cast, and language in order to allow executives to make informed decisions. This can help Netflix produce content that is attractive to consumers and will aid in sustaining growth as well as retaining current customers.

Goal: 

Predict how viewers will rate a new movie based on factors such as duration, cast, and language in order to allow executives to make greenlight decisions.

Conclusion:

With a Random Forest model, we can generate fairly accurate predictions that, in combination with the insight and intuition of Netflix professionals, can lead to better decisions.
